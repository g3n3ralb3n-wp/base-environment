    "# Weekly Discussion Forum Participation\n",

    "Each week, you are required to participate in the module’s discussion forum. The discussion forum consists of the week's Module Activity, which is released at the beginning of the module. You must complete/attempt the activity before you can post about the activity and anything that relates to the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading of the Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initial Post:\n",
    "Create your thread by **Day 5 (Saturday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Responses:\n",
    "Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7 (Monday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your participation will be graded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Credit (100 points):\n",
    "- Submit your initial post by **Day 5.**\n",
    "- Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half Credit (50 points):\n",
    "- If your initial post is late but you respond to two other posts.\n",
    "- If your initial post is on time but you fail to respond to at least two other posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Credit (0 points):\n",
    "- If both your initial post and responses are late.\n",
    "- If you fail to submit an initial post and do not respond to any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Late Initial Posts:** Late posts will automatically receive half credit if two responses are completed on time.\n",
    "- **Substance Matters:** Responses must be thoughtful and constructive. Comments like “Great post!” or “I agree!” without further explanation will not earn credit.\n",
    "- **Balance Participation:** Aim to engage with threads that have fewer or no responses to ensure a balanced discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid:\n",
    "- A number of posts within a very short time-frame, especially immediately prior to the posting deadline.\n",
    "- Posts that complement another post, and then consist of a summary of that.\n"

    "A set is a built-in, mutable data structure in Python that represents an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces `{}`, designed for mathematical set operations and membership testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unordered**: Elements have no defined order or index. The order of elements may vary and is not guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unique Elements**: Automatically eliminates duplicate values; each element can appear only once in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mutable**: The set itself can be modified after creation—elements can be added or removed (though elements must be immutable types).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unhashable Elements Not Allowed**: Elements must be of immutable types (integers, strings, tuples). Lists, dictionaries, or other sets cannot be set elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Indexing**: Since sets are unordered, elements cannot be accessed by index or position.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fast Membership Testing**: Uses hash tables internally, providing O(1) average time complexity for checking if an element exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Mathematical Operations**: Supports set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:** `{element1, element2, element3, ...}` or `set()` for empty set (note: `{}` creates an empty dictionary)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Operations:** Add (`set.add(item)`), remove (`set.remove(item)`), union (`set1 | set2`), intersection (`set1 & set2`), difference (`set1 - set2`), membership testing (`item in set`)."
